# Harvard Math 21a

This repo houses my self-study artifacts from Harvard's [Math 21a](http://abel.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/math21a2019/index.html) (as taught by Oliver Knill in Fall 2019) including homework problems, miscellaneous study aids, associated code, and exams/exam prep work.

**Note**: These PDFs may be relatively large and will likely not render correctly (or at all) via Github. For best results, download a copy of each PDF and open locally.
